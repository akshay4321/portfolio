- Worked on a project ‘SuratCricUps’; It's a sport management project exclusively for the game of cricket. 
- In my project, I took charge of a system with three parts: Admin, Organizer, and Player. As the Admin, I managed live cricket scores. Being an Organizer, I helped pick players to make teams based on their profiles. I also let players create and handle their profiles, making it easy for organizers and players to communicate smoothly.
- Tested sites in various browsers and devices to ensure cross-browser compatibility and mobile responsiveness.
- Written modern, performant, maintainable code for the project.
